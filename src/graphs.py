Graphs:
There are composed by nodes or vertex.
Between each nodes there are edge or connections. 

So we have vertices and edges. Each vertex can have an edge with other vertex and so on.
There are no limits of how many vertices I can be connected on.

Essentially, for go to one vertex to another, I can weight the edges (to quantify the cost),
and then, I could enroute the lighest path to reach a given edge. 

Tipically this data structred is illustrated in social media platofrms. 
i.e, in Instagram when I follow a celebrity, he/she doesn't follow me back, so the edge in unidirectional between two vertex.
but if I follow a friend, most probable the friend will follow me back and then the relation of the vertices will be bidirectional.
So, vertex relation through edges could be bi-directional or uni-directional.

Trees are a form of graphs, but trees has the limitation that each edge could point only to two nodes. 
And a trees are a form of a tree, with the limitation that they only can point to another node. 
But essentially those data structures are closely related.
