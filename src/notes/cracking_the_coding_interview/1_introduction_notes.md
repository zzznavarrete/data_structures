# Cracking the coding interview - Raw notes

The following section is about raw notes that I've taken through the lecture of the book 'Cracking the coding interview - 6th edition'. 

## Introduction
**Important**: According to the author, the interview itself is not about flawless solving a problem, instead is an evaluation of how good I'm answering questions *better than other candidates*. It is okay to not be flawless.

- Study hard, practice and good luck :).

To preparing for coding interview is necessary to prepare with real questions, real problems and understand its patterns. It isn't enough with fancy academic books problems, which most probably will lead me to be a better software engineer but for interview matters, that isn't the best guide.

This book is about the author, and how he applied his knowledge about the widely kind of coding problems, and challenges. This book is about coding and design questions.

### The interview process

The interviewer is looking to evaluate my ability to solve algorithmic problems that I haven't seen before.
I must do my best on **talk out loud throught the problem and explain my throught process**.
The interviewer might jump sometimes to help me, it's normal, doesn't mean that I'm doing poorly, it's just to evaluate how good my teamwork skills and capability to catch requirements are.

Some of the skills that the interviewer will be looking into are:
- Analytical skills: Did I need much help to solve the problem? How optimal was my solution? How long did it take until I arrive the solution? Did I think about the trade-offs involve in my design solution?

- Coding skills: Was I able to successfully translate the algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did I think about potential edge-cases/errors?

- Technical kowledge / CS Fundamentals: Do I have strong fundations in computer science?

- Experience: Have I made good technical decisions in the past? Did I built interesting challengin projects? Have I shown initiative and other important factors?

- Culture fit / Communciation skills: Do my values and personality fits the company? Did I communicate well with my interviewer?


#### WHY?
Why the companies focus on the previous items? 
It's because they're too focus on getting good engineers that they can accept have *false negatives*. They accepts that good candidates could be rejected (they prefered not to, obviously) but for the sake of keeping the bar high, they develop this framework to cut the engineers that does goods in interviews but poorly in the real work.

#### Problem solving skills are valuable
Companies values candidates that can show good skills at problem solving, If I'm able to work through several hard problems (with some help, perhaps) I might be very good at develop optimal algorithms.


#### Basic data structure and alkgorithm knowledge is useful.

It is difficult to know when I should use a binary search tree if I didn't know about its existence. Understanding the trees, graphs, lists, sorting, etc will help to elaborate or rely on the kwnoledge once approaching differents challenges.

**Whiteboarding allows me to focus the attention on the interesting part of the code**.
More often, the interviewers are not okay with pseudo-code, so, even though I don't need to make my code to run, I should try to code in the whiteboard if asked. Is better a few errors or some synthatical errors than pseudo-code.

#### How questions are selected

Usually, the questions between different companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc) are the same or very similar (with certain focus in different areas depending each company), so there is no thing like 'recent question of company X', the questions are often the same for the recent years.

#### How candidates are evaluated 
It's all about how I perform at answering certain question in comparison with other candidates. In terms of time that took me to develop the idea, the communication skills showed through the thought process, the complexity, etc. It is all relative. 




## Behavioral Questions
The purpose of the behavioral question is to get known my personality, to understand my resume more deeply.

### Interview preparation grid
Go through the different roles/experiences of my resume and being able to talk about them in terms of: (make sure to have at least 3 experiences/projects to talk about each topic)
- Challenges, 
- Mistakes/Failures,
- Enjoyed, 
- Leadership,
- Conflicts 
- What You'd Do Differently.

It can be tought in terms of a table:



| Common Questions   |      Project 1      |  Project 2 | Project 3|
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| Challenges |   | ||
| Mistakes/Failures |      |    ||
| Enjoyed |  |     ||
| Leadership |  |    ||
| Conflicts |  |    ||
| What You'd do differently |  |    ||


_Tips_: Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid easier to study and recall. In addition, I need to make sure to have one to three projects that I can talk about it in detail. I should be able to discuss the technical components in depth. These should be projects where I played a central role.

**Weaknesses**
Be real about weaknesses, don't give answers like "my greatest weakness is that I work too hard", this is just counterproductive, and will make my interviewer to think I'm arrogant. A good answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how I work to overcome it.

> e.g: "Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."

**What questions should I ask to my interviewer?**
It is a key factor that I should make great questions. An examples of those could be separated in three categories:
1. Genuine questions
There are the questions I actually want to know the answers to. Here are a few ideas:
- "How does project planning happen on the team?"
- "What brought you to this company?"
- "What has been most challenging for you?"

2. Insightful questions
This questions demostrates my knowledge in technology
- "I notice that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"
- "Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? "
Asking such questions will typically require advance research about the company.


3. Passion questions
These questions are designed to demostrate my passion for technology. They show that I'm interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.
- "I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?"


### Known my technical projects
As part of my preparation, I should be able to focus on two or three technical projects and deeply master on the technical and overview topics. Take into account:
- Projects that has challenging components _(beyond just "learning a lot")_.
- Projects that I played a central role _(ideally on the callenging components)_.
- Talk depth in terms of the technical side.


For those and all my projects, I should be able to talk in depth about the callenges, mistakes, technical decisions, choises of technologies (and tradeoffs of these), and the things I would do differently.

I can also think in possible follow up questions, like how I would scale the application.

### Responding to behavioral questions

Key things to remember regarding this section:
- **Be specific, not arrogant.**
For example, rather tan just say "I did all the hard parts", I could describe the specifics I did to address the challenge and what makes that challenging.

- **Limit details**
Beign able to capture and transmit the key idea of the experiencie, and ask the interviewer if he/she wanted you to get more into technical details.

- **Focus in myself, not the team.**
Interviews are fundamentally an individual assesment. Be aware of using the words "we", "us", etc. This usually do not lead into a good position in the interviewers eyes. 

- **Give structured answers**
Two techniques that can asses this.
a. Nugget
b. S.A.R

Nugget: Let known my interviewer what's the story about at the beginning and then start to telling it.
For example: • Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change."
• Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach
their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where..."

This technique grabs your interviewer's attention and makes it very ciear what your story will be about It also helps you be more focused in your communication.

S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result)
The S.A.R approach means that I start outlining the situation, then explaining the actions I took and finally describing the result.

- Example:"Tell me about a challenging interaction with a teammate." 

• Situation: On my operating systems project, I was assigned to work with three other people. While two were great, the third team member didn't contribute much. He stayed quiet during meetings, rarely chipped in during email discussions, and struggled to complete his components. This was an issue not only because it shifted more work onto us, but also because we didn't know if we could count on him.
• Action: I didn't want to write him off completely yet, so I tried to resoive the situation. I did three things.
First, I wanted to understand why he was acting like this. Was it laziness? Was he busy with something else? I struck up a conversation with him and then asked him open-ended questions about how he felt it was going. Interestingly, basically out of nowhere, he said that he wanted to take on the writeup, which is one of the most time intensive parts. This showed me that it wasn't laziness; it was that he didn't feel like he was good enough to write code.
Second, now that I understand the cause, I tried to make it clear that he shouldn't fear messing up, I told him about some of the bigger mistakes that I made and admitted that I wasn't ciear about a lot of parts of the project either.
Third and finally, 1 asked him to help me with breaking out some of the components of the project. We sat down together and designed a thorough spec for one of the big component, in much more detail than we had before. Once he could see all the pieces, it helped show him that the project wasn't as scary as he'd assumed.
• Result: With his confidence raised, he now offered to take on a bunch of the smaller coding work, and then eventually some of the biggest parts. He finished all his work on time, and he contributed more in
discussions. We were happy to work with him on a future project.



By using the S.A.R, model with clear situations, actions and results, the interviewer will be able to easily identify how you made an impact and why it mattered.

**Put emphasis in the action**
Most people spend more time talking about the situation isntead of the action. I should pay more energy on the action, in fact, where possible I could breakdown the action into multiple parts, for example:
- I did three things, First I..."




Think About What It Says

What personality attributes has the candidate demonstrated? 

• Initiative/Leadership: The candidate tried to resolve the situation by addressing it head-on. 

• Empathy; The candidate tried to understand what was happening to the person. The candidate also showed empathy in knowing what would resolve the teammate's insecurity.

• Compassion: Although the teammate was harming the team, the candidate wasn't angry at the teammate. His empathy led him to compassion.

• Humility: The candidate was able to admit to his own flaws (not only to the teammate, but also to the interviewer),

• Teamwork/Helpfulness: The candidate worked with the teammate to break down the project into manageable chunks.
**I should think about your stories from this perspective.**

### So, tell me about yourself... 

Many interviewers kick off the session by asking you to tell them a bit about yourself, or asking you to walk through your resume. This is essentially a "pitch". It's your interviewer's first impression of you, so you want to be sure to nail this.

- Structure
A typical structure that works well for many people is essentially chronological, with the opening sentence describing their current job and the conclusion discussing their relevant and interesting hobbies outside of work (if any).

1. Current Role [Headline Only): "I'm a software engineer at Microworks, where I've been leading the Android team for the last five years."
2. College: My background is in computer science, I did my undergrad at Berkeley and spent a few summers working at startups, including one where I attempted to launch my own business,
3. Post College & Onwards: After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got to really drive the launch of a key part of AWS. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment.
4. Current Role (Details): One of my old managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup, which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaled pretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage a team of three, but my rote is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.
5. Outside of Work: Outside of work, I've been participating in some hackathons—mostly doing iOS development there as a way to learn it more deeply. I'm also active as a moderator on online forums around Android development.
6. Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved the connection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.

This structure works well for about 95% of candidates.

**Hobbies** 
Think carefully about your hobbies. You mayor may not want to discuss them.
Often they're just fluff. If your hobby is just generic activities like skiing or playing with your dog, you can probably skip it.


### Sprinkle in Shows of Successes
In the above pitch, the candidate has casually dropped in some highlights of his background. 
• He specifically mentioned that he was recruited out of Microworks by his old manager, which shows that he was successful at Amazon.
» He also mentions wanting to be in a smaller environment, which shows some element of culture fit (assuming this is a startup he's applying for).
• He mentions some successes he's had, such as launching a key part of AWS and architecting a scalable system.
• He mentions his hobbies, both of which show a drive to learn.

When you think about your pitch, think about what different aspects of your background say about you. 
Can you can drop in shows of successes (awards, promotions, being recruited out by someone you worked with, launches, etc.)? What do you want to communicate about yourself?
