## Cracking the coding interview - Raw notes

The following section is about raw notes that I've taken through the lecture of the book 'Cracking the coding interview - 6th edition'. 

### Introduction.
**Important**: According to the author, the interview itself is not about flawless solving a problem, instead is an evaluation of how good I'm answering questions *better than other candidates*. It is okay to not be flawless.

- Study hard, practice and good luck :).

To preparing for coding interview is necessary to prepare with real questions, real problems and understand its patterns. It isn't enough with fancy academic books problems, which most probably will lead me to be a better software engineer but for interview matters, that isn't the best guide.

This book is about the author, and how he applied his knowledge about the widely kind of coding problems, and challenges. This book is about coding and design questions.

### The interview process

The interviewer is looking to evaluate my ability to solve algorithmic problems that I haven't seen before.
I must do my best on **talk out loud throught the problem and explain my throught process**.
The interviewer might jump sometimes to help me, it's normal, doesn't mean that I'm doing poorly, it's just to evaluate how good my teamwork skills and capability to catch requirements are.

Some of the skills that the interviewer will be looking into are:
- Analytical skills: Did I need much help to solve the problem? How optimal was my solution? How long did it take until I arrive the solution? Did I think about the trade-offs involve in my design solution?

- Coding skills: Was I able to successfully translate the algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did I think about potential edge-cases/errors?

- Technical kowledge / CS Fundamentals: Do I have strong fundations in computer science?

- Experience: Have I made good technical decisions in the past? Did I built interesting challengin projects? Have I shown initiative and other important factors?

- Culture fit / Communciation skills: Do my values and personality fits the company? Did I communicate well with my interviewer?


#### WHY?
Why the companies focus on the previous items? 
It's because they're too focus on getting good engineers that they can accept have *false negatives*. They accepts that good candidates could be rejected (they prefered not to, obviously) but for the sake of keeping the bar high, they develop this framework to cut the engineers that does goods in interviews but poorly in the real work.

#### Problem solving skills are valuable
Companies values candidates that can show good skills at problem solving, If I'm able to work through several hard problems (with some help, perhaps) I might be very good at develop optimal algorithms.


#### Basic data structure and alkgorithm knowledge is useful.

It is difficult to know when I should use a binary search tree if I didn't know about its existence. Understanding the trees, graphs, lists, sorting, etc will help to elaborate or rely on the kwnoledge once approaching differents challenges.

**Whiteboarding allows me to focus the attention on the interesting part of the code**.
More often, the interviewers are not okay with pseudo-code, so, even though I don't need to make my code to run, I should try to code in the whiteboard if asked. Is better a few errors or some synthatical errors than pseudo-code.

#### How questions are selected

Usually, the questions between different companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc) are the same or very similar (with certain focus in different areas depending each company), so there is no thing like 'recent question of company X', the questions are often the same for the recent years.

#### How candidates are evaluated 
It's all about how I perform at answering certain question in comparison with other candidates. In terms of time that took me to develop the idea, the communication skills showed through the thought process, the complexity, etc. It is all relative.
